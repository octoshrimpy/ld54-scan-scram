# Modifiers
Sleeping guardian spirit
Overrun by bioluminescent flora
Echoes with distant chanting
Haunted by flickering holograms
Hidden beneath creeping fog
Patrolled by ancient drones
Shrouded in electromagnetic storms
Guarded by territorial fauna
Contains unstable teleport nodes
Anchored by gravity anomalies
Veiled by shimmering heat haze
Infested with parasitic vines
Studied by clandestine prospectors
Marked with forbidden sigils
Awaiting a lunar alignment
Echoing with whale-song vibrations
Covered in crystalline frost
Swarmed by inquisitive sprites
Corrupted by void leakage
Conducting erratic lightning arcs
Whispering forgotten coordinates
Linked by secret maintenance tunnels
Resonating with seismic pulses
Tethered to a pocket dimension
Basking in perpetual twilight
Warded by sentient moss
Breathing with geothermal vents
Illuminated by plasma fireflies
Encoded with resistance graffiti
Interlaced with AI oversight
Crawling with scrap scavengers
Echoing with orbital traffic
Haunted by temporal afterimages
Blanketed in luminescent spores
Stabilized by harmonic emitters
Nestled within floating debris
Beneath watchful survey satellites
Propagating curious radio pings
Flooded by refractive mist
Guarded by a displaced colossus
Singing with resonance crystals
Veined with molten glass
Wrapped in living root networks
Shared with an allied caravan
Projected across time fractures
Shadowed by titanic bones
Orbiting a dormant drill rig
Occupied by rival explorers
Recovering from sabotage
Lingering above a magnetic storm
